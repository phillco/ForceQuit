What is ForceQuit?
==================

ForceQuit stops you from obsessively checking your favorite websites (which sucks away happiness and productivity). With ForceQuit, you corrall your browsing time into a fixed number of "dosages" (default 3) that you can use throughout the day. When you need a break, pull up ForceQuit and enjoy a dosage. Otherwise, no browsing for you.

Each "dose" lasts for up to 30 minutes, and once they're gone, they're gone. The longer you take, the longer you have to wait until the next one. Oh, and we'll automatically kill your browser if you try to go one of your sites between doses.

Sound good?
