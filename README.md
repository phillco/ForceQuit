What is ForceQuit?
==================

I wrote ForceQuit when I noticed that I was pulling up my favorite news sites (Reddit, Hacker News, Gmail) hundreds of times a day - even if there wasn't anything new to read! It was sucking away my focus and happiness.

ForceQuit stops you from obsessively checking your favorite websites by corralling your browsing time into a fixed number of "dosages" (default 3) that you can use throughout the day. When you need a break, pull up ForceQuit and enjoy a dosage. Otherwise, no browsing for you.

Each "dose" lasts for up to 30 minutes. Once they're gone, they're gone. The longer you take, the longer you have to wait until the next one. Oh, and we'll automatically kill your browser if you try to go one of your sites between doses.

Sound good?
