What is ForceQuit?
==================

I wrote ForceQuit when I noticed that I was pulling up news sites (Reddit, Hacker News, Gmail) dozens of times a day - even if there wasn't anything new to read!

ForceQuit stops you from obsessively checking your favorite websites by corralling the time you spend there into a fixed number of "dosages" (default 3) that you can use throughout the day. When you need a break, pull up ForceQuit and enjoy a dosage. Otherwise, no browsing for you.

Each "dose" lasts for 30 minutes, max. Once they're gone, they're gone. The longer you take, the longer you have to wait until the next one. Oh, and we'll automatically kill your browser if you try to go one of your sites between doses.

Sound good?
